## Develop locally

`elm-live src/Main.elm -- --output=dist/main.js`

dist/main.js will be the output, this can be changed to any folder

## Production

- compile elm to the correct location that will be served by the server:
`elm make src/Main.elm --output dist/main.js `

- let the server serve index.html file which has script from that generated by elm
